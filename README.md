Welcome to the Bonetech Studios website! Here you will find out everything that we've been working on since our last update, including new projects, events, and the latest news and media coverage from around the web. Please don't email us. We are not a company that exists for customer service or inquiries, as that would distract us from actually making mods. We've had some problems with spam bots hitting the contact form, so we decided to stop taking messages via it entirely.
Thank you for your continued support and interest in all things bonetech!

### About Us
